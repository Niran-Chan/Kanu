Welcome to Kanu, where we hope to make changes to the world in whichever way we can! We hope that this project can be further expanded to help minimise global food wastage. It is made with the idea of a leftover food marketplace, with buyers and sellers selling away any leftover food rather than throwing them away. 




# Getting Started

### Git Cloning and setting up environment for Gatsby
You need to install some packages and dependencies! First thing is to git clone our current project! 

Once done git cloning, run 
```npm install -g gatsby```
Then, traverse to the directory with 
```cd ./kanu``

If your Gatsby has any issues, do refer to gatsby's getting started documentation: 
``` https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-0/```

Once done, we also need a local instance of gatsby installed into the project so lets run 
``` npm i gatsby ```

### Starting up

Run ``` gatsby develop ```
 
If there are any issues with your develop, you can try 

	gatsby clean
	gatbsy develop
